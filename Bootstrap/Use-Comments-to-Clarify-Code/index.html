<!-- When we start using jQuery, we will modify HTML elements without needing to actually change them in HTML.

Let's make sure that everyone knows they shouldn't actually modify any of this code directly.

Remember that you can start a comment with <!-- and end a comment with -->

<!-- Add a comment at the top of your HTML that says Code below this line should not be changed --> -->
